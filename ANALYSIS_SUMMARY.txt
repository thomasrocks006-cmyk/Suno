WHAT IS THIS APP?
-----------------
An AI-powered prompt engineering studio for Suno v5 music generation.
Generates optimized lyrics, style tags, and provides professional-grade analysis.

KEY TECHNOLOGIES:
-----------------
- React 19.2.0 + TypeScript 5.8.2
- Vite 6.2.0 (build tool)
- Google Gemini AI (3.0 Pro & 2.5 Flash)
- Imagen 4.0 (album cover generation)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)

CORE FEATURES:
--------------
1. Song Generation (with 10+ parameters)
2. Deep Analysis (6-category scoring: 0-100)
3. Smart Line Editor (AI-assisted editing)
4. Version Tracking (V1, V2, V3...)
5. Variations Generator (2 alternative takes)
6. Advanced Lyric Logic Mode
7. Central Metaphor Mode

SCORING SYSTEM:
---------------
Six Fixed Categories:
1. Lyrical Originality
2. Melodic & Phonetic Flow
3. Emotional Impact
4. Structure & Pacing
5. Commercial Potential
6. Thematic Cohesion

Unique Metrics:
- Cinema Audit (counts physical objects in lyrics)
- Phonetic Analysis (vowel/consonant patterns)
- Projected Score (potential after improvements)

ARCHITECTURE:
-------------
├── App.tsx (orchestrator, state management)
├── services/geminiService.ts (all AI calls)
├── components/ (8 UI components)
├── types.ts (TypeScript definitions)
└── 3,021 total lines of code

EFFECTIVENESS:
--------------
✅ Excellent for: Iterative improvement, learning tool, baseline standardization
✅ Works best for: Beginners, commercial pop/rock, lyric-centric songs
⚠️  Limitations: Genre bias, no audio analysis, cultural specificity

OVERALL GRADE: A- (Highly Recommended)
- Codebase Quality: A (Professional)
- Feature Completeness: B+ (Very Good)
- Scoring Validity: B (Good with Limitations)
- User Value: A (Excellent for Target Audience)

PERFORMANCE:
------------
Speed:
- Generation: 8-12 seconds
- Analysis: 15-25 seconds (background)
- Rewrite: 10-15 seconds

Cost per song: ~$0.08 (generation + analysis + cover art)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
For Developers:
- Add export functionality (download lyrics/styles)
- Implement undo/redo for editing
- Create unit tests for scoring logic
- Add telemetry for feature usage
- Consider streaming responses

For Users:
- Start with logic modes disabled
- Use V1 vs V2 comparisons
- Trust the Cinema Audit metric
- Experiment with variations
- Don't obsess over scores (use as guides)

For Product:
- Audio integration is #1 priority
- Freemium monetization model
- Community features (sharing, voting)
- Mobile PWA app
